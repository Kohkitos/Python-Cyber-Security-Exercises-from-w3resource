# Python-Cyber-Security-Exercises-from-w3resource

Welcome to my repository! These are the solutions I had for the exercised proposed by w3resource. I started doing these exercises both because I want to apply my Python knowledge to my Cyber Security position and also because I wanted to refresh my Python, since I haven't develop for a year as per the creation of this repository.
